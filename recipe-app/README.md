In the recipe-app directory, execute 'npm install' to configure the environment. This will create a large node_modules folders which should not be pushed to github. 
Then, execute 'npm run dev' to start the development server. The terminal will tell you which local host port to access in your browser. Hitting 'q' + 'Enter' in the terminal shuts down the server.
